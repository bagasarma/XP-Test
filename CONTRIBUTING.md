# Contributing to TaskEasy

Thank you for your interest in contributing to TaskEasy! This document outlines our development process and guidelines.

## Development Workflow

### 1. Setting Up Your Development Environment

\`\`\`bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/taskeasy.git
cd taskeasy

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
\`\`\`

### 2. Branch Strategy

We use a Git flow-inspired branching strategy:

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/*` - Feature development branches
- `hotfix/*` - Critical bug fixes for production

### 3. Creating a Feature Branch

\`\`\`bash
# Switch to develop branch
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Create a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make your changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat(scope): description of changes"

# Push your branch
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
\`\`\`

## Extreme Programming (XP) Practices

### Pair Programming

- Use VS Code Live Share for remote pairing sessions
- Switch driver/navigator roles every 25 minutes
- Include both developers' initials in commit messages: `[AB/CD]`

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

1. **Red**: Write a failing test first
2. **Green**: Write minimal code to make the test pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve the code while keeping tests green

\`\`\`bash
# Run tests in watch mode during development
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
\`\`\`

### Continuous Integration

All code must pass these checks before merging:

- TypeScript type checking
- ESLint linting
- Jest unit tests (70%+ coverage)
- Build verification

### Small Releases

- Make small, focused commits
- Create pull requests for code review
- Deploy frequently to get feedback

## Code Quality Standards

### Commit Message Convention

We follow the conventional commits specification:

\`\`\`
type(scope): description

Types:
- feat: A new feature
- fix: A bug fix
- docs: Documentation changes
- style: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- refactor: Code refactoring
- test: Adding or updating tests
- chore: Maintenance tasks

Examples:
feat(tasks): add task creation functionality
fix(ui): resolve button alignment issue
test(utils): add tests for task validation
\`\`\`

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow ESLint rules (automatically enforced)
- Write meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused

### Testing Guidelines

- Write tests for all new features
- Maintain 70%+ code coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

\`\`\`typescript
// Good test example
describe('TaskForm', () => {
  it('should call addTask when form is submitted with valid data', async () => {
    // Arrange
    const mockAddTask = jest.fn()
    render(<TaskForm addTask={mockAddTask} />)
    
    // Act
    await user.type(screen.getByLabelText(/title/i), 'Test Task')
    await user.click(screen.getByRole('button', { name: /add task/i }))
    
    // Assert
    expect(mockAddTask).toHaveBeenCalledWith({
      title: 'Test Task',
      // ... other properties
    })
  })
})
\`\`\`

## Pull Request Process

### Before Creating a PR

1. Ensure all tests pass: `npm test`
2. Check code coverage: `npm run test:coverage`
3. Run linting: `npm run lint`
4. Build the project: `npm run build`
